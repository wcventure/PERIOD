Ok, Here's a developer's primer for aget source:

The code is splitted into several files:

main.{c|h}
	* starts a thread for handling signals.
	* gets program options and decides the 
	  program's behviour by setting a few 
 	  global variables.

Aget.{c|h} 
	* get() and resume_get() functions
	  starts the download process. Depending on the
	  protocol, necessary methods are called.
	  
	  resume_get() is for resume jobs. If the there 
	  is a log file of a previous job, the values 
	  are taken from it.

Head.{c|h}
	* Before the actual download, a head request
	  is sent to the server to determine the current
	  status of the file.
          Some values like:
		1. HTTP return code (e.g. 404, 206, 403, 200)
		2. Content-length

	  might be of interest there.

Ftp.{c|h}
       * ftp_get() function which is the thread runner for ftp
 	 downloads.

Download.{c|h}
	* Aget is no more %100 Posix compliant :(
	  pwrite is from X_OPEN standarts. I had to do it, since I needed
	  a way to simultaneously write to the same file without loosing
	  any time while synchronising the threads.
	  
	  For the time, there is only http_get. When aget is ftp-aware
  	  ftp_get will be in this file.


Resume.{c|h}
	* Methods about saving and restoring history files are in this
	  file.

Signal.{c|h}
	* Signal Handling functions.

Misc.{c|h}
	* Other functions which do not fit any of the general categories
 	  are stored here. These are generally helper functions...
